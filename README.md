This frontend is built using React.js with React Router for smooth navigation across pages like login, registration, and recipe management. It provides a clean and responsive UI where users can add, edit, delete, and view recipes, including image uploads. Local storage is used to temporarily persist recipe data and user session details for a seamless experience. The codebase is modular, with reusable components and clear routing structure, ensuring easy scalability for future features such as search, filters, and cloud-based storage integration.
